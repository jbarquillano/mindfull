                    <h3>Diaphragmatic Breathing</h3>
                    <p>When diaphragmatic breathing, focus more on engaging the diaphragm to take deep, controlled breaths. To practice, you should inhale deeply through the nose to allow your belly to expand, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. A few benefits of this technique are improvements in oxygen flow, reduced stress, and enhanced lung efficiency, which is useful to help you relax and is beneficial to your overall respiratory health.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Box Breathing</h3>
                    <p>Box breathing is a more structured breathing technique which involves inhaling for four seconds, holding your breath for four seconds, exhaling for four seconds, and holding your breath for four seconds again before repeating the cycle again. The benefits of box breathing are it helps to calm your nervous system, reduce stress, improves focus, and decreases anxiety.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Alternate Nostril Breathing</h3>
                    <p>To start alternate nostril breathing, you must close one nostril while inhaling, then switch nostrils before exhaling. This technique is used in yoga and mediation and is believed to balance the body's energy, improve mental clarity, and reduce stress. By breathing with intentions, alternate nostril breathing is beneficial as it improves your overall well-being and helps with relaxation.</p>

                    <h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
                <p>Cognitive behavioural therapy is a goal-oriented therapy that is more focused on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviours.

CBT is mostly used to treat anxiety, depression, PTSD, and other mental health conditions.</p>
                
                <h3>Psychodynamic Therapy</h3>
                <p>Psychodynamic therapy explores an individuals unconscious thoughts, past experiences, and unresolved conflicts that might be affecting a persons behaviour and emotions.

Psychodynamic therapy is often used for those with deep emotional issues and can help with long-term personal development. .</p>
                
                <h3>Art Therapy</h3>
                <p>Art therapy is a type of psychotherapy that involves more creative activities, such as painting, drawing, sculpting, or collage as a tool for communication.
